# About the Project
The project is a part of the Series Visualizing the Code with Geekosophers which is designed to give users the ability to visualize different morphological operations which includes- Dilation, Erosion, Opening and Closing.

**Brief about the series-** It is an initiative taken by us to bring the world of algorithms closer to the tech enthusiasts by helping them visualise the algorithms. Join us in this journey where we will be covering a wide range of algorithms from Simple Binary search to complex Data Structure and Algorithms.

# Morphological Operations
## 1. Dilation
Dilation is one of the most common morphological operation along with Erosion. Dilation is used to add pixels to the boundary of the input image making the object more visible and fill small voids in the image.
Dilation operator takes two inputs, one is the image and the other one is the structuring element. The structuring element determines the effect of dilation on the input image.

### Key points about Dilation-
1. Dilation is the dual of erosion.
2. Size of input and output image is same.
3. It grows the object and fill any voids in the input image.
4. The nature of thickening is determined by the structuring element.
5. Dilation can be performed on Binary images as well as Grayscale images
